PenBSD

PenBSD is a minimal, BSD‑based penetration testing and educational operating system built on GhostBSD and FreeBSD.

Its goal is not only to provide security tools, but to teach how systems really work, using the BSD philosophy: simplicity, correctness, and clarity.

PenBSD installs only software that is actually useful for penetration testing, security research, and learning.
There are no unnecessary graphical tools, no visual gimmicks, and no “showcase” packages.

Key principles

Minimalism – only essential tools are included

Education – the system encourages understanding, not blind tool usage

Security – sane defaults, doas instead of sudo, jails, clean permissions

Real‑world skills – focus on networking, system internals, and embedded environments

Features

Based on GhostBSD / FreeBSD

doas as the default privilege escalation tool

Zsh with a productivity‑focused configuration

Core penetration testing tools (networking, web, passwords)

BusyBox for embedded and appliance environments

Toybox via Linuxulator for Android and mobile pentesting familiarity

Linux compatibility layer for selected Linux tools

Educational materials and helper commands built into the system

What PenBSD is not

Not a general‑purpose desktop OS

Not a flashy “hacker” distribution

Not a collection of random tools

PenBSD is designed for people who want to learn security seriously, understand operating systems deeply, and work close to real‑world environments.

Philosophy

PenBSD is not only a penetration testing system — it is a learning environment for understanding security the BSD way
